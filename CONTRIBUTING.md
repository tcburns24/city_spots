Before making a contribution, please read this document fully and follow all instructions.


## Pull Request Process
1. All contributions should be made via Pull Requests from a forked & cloned local repository.
2. Small commits are good. In order to promote precision in a contributions' functionality, limit the amount of code per commit so that the purpose of the contributions clear upon code reviews.
3. If your contribution is in response to an existing issue, please include the issue title in your branch title.  
4. Include a brief explanation of your PR in the comment section. What problem were you attempting to solve? What does your code change, add, or delete? What will be different upon merging your PR?
5. Once a branch has been merged, delete it.

  * swear words
  * condescending phrases
  * sexism
  * sexually charged phrases
  * allusions to a person's religion, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, and education
3. Do not give or request personal information (e.g. passwords, social security numbers, banking information, or addresses).
