# README

Welcome to CitySpots! An open source web app designed to help travelers research their destinations, and share worthwhile spots with their wanderlust brethren.

CitySpots was built with Ruby 2.3.1 on Rails 5.1.2.

## What's It All About?
CitySpots is a website developed for those who proudly claim membership to the wanderlust community. If you love to travel, and love to share your traveling experiences, CitySpots is for you. CitySpots' ultimate goal is to emerge as the most trusted site where travelers can seek recommendations in preparation to travel.

To reach this goal, please be mindful of the User's Guidelines below. Adhering to the guidelines is essential in cultivating CitySpots' credibility and affect on others in the community.

## User Guidelines
### 1. Post a spot only if you have been to it.
Travel recommendations are must useful when they come from firsthand accounts. If you have not physically been to a spot, don't post it or comment on it.

### 2. Post facts, not opinions.
When posting or commenting on a spot, start with facts. When were you there? What type of venue is the spot? Who is the clientele? Facts are the most efficient way to paint a picture of a spot for a potential future-visitor. After you've shared facts about the spot, feel free to share your opinions unless they are disrespectful. "The steak au poivre was dry and a bit too chewy for my taste" is not disrespectful to the business but "the steak au poivre was crummy don't get it" is.

### 3. Disagree politely.
It's fine to share a differing opinion about a spot as long as it's done tactfully. "Actually, I found the steak au poivre to be quite juicy and delicious" is a helpful way to provide future visitors with a different point of view on a spot. "No, Stupid! The steak au poivre was great. What are you talking about!?" does not respect the original comment nor does it help future visitors form an unbiased frame on which to build their own opinion.

### 4. Refrain from vulgar language.
This includes:
  * Swear words
  * Sexually charged language
